Options,Default,Description
tolerance,1.00E-10,"Tolerance for the NS residual, below which the solver exits"
CFL: initial,10,"Exponential CFL ramping, from initial to final, over _rampSteps_ steps"
CFL: final,200,
CFL: rampSteps,200,
linearIterations,25,Number of linear solver iterations
kappaMUSCL,-1,"Kappa for the MUSCL scheme, range from [-1, 1], with 1 being unstable."
maxDt,1.00E+100,Maximum time step
startEnforcingMaxDtStep,-1,Time step at which to start enforcing maxDtStep. Default of -1 does not enforce a max time step.
updateJacobianFrequency,4,Frequency at which the jacobian is updated.
equationEvalFrequency,1,Frequency at which to update the NS equation in loosely-coupled simulations
viscousWaveSpeedScale,0,"Scales the wave speed acording to a viscous flux. 0.0 is no speed correction, with larger values providing a larger viscous wave speed correction."
