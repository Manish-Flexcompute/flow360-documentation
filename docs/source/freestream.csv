Options,Default,Description
Reynolds,REQUIRED,"Nondimensional Reynolds number. Reynolds number should be computed based on the reference length in grid units. For example, if you have a mesh with a MAC of 100 in grid units and want to simulate a physical Reynolds number of 1M, then the you should set Reynolds = 100,000."
Mach,REQUIRED,"The Mach number, the ratio of freestream speed to the speed of sound."
Temperature,REQUIRED,The reference temperature in Kelvin.
alphaAngle,REQUIRED,The angle of attack in degrees
betaAngle,REQUIRED,The side slip angle in degrees
